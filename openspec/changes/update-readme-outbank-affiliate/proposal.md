# Change: Update README with Outbank affiliate link and construction note

## Why
The README needs to reference the new Outbank affiliate link with clear disclosure and remove redundant app store badges now that the affiliate page covers downloads. The README should also communicate the project is under construction with an explicit note that the purpose is not finalized yet.

## What Changes
- Add the Outbank affiliate link to the README with a transparent disclosure.
- Remove the App Store and Google Play badge section from the README.
- Add an under-construction note stating the reason for the affiliate link is not finalized.

## Impact
- Affected specs: documentation (new capability)
- Affected code: `README.md`
